Installation:

- Place a copy of the script and filter file somewhere important like
      /etc/bak/bak-system.sh
      /etc/bak/bak-system.filter

  Make sure the script is executable.

- Modify the src and dest variables and possibly command switches to reflect your backup needs. Specify the proper path to the filter file if necessary.

  DON'T FORGET to comment out the --dry-run switch assignment once you think
  it's ready!

- Put something like this in your root user's crontab:

      30 02 * * * sh -c '/etc/bak/bak-system.sh > /var/log/bak-system.log' || echo "ERROR exit code $?"

- Perhaps get logrotate involved to keep the log from getting out of
  control. A file like /etc/logrotate.d/bak containing:

      /var/log/bak-system.log {
         rotate 7
         daily
         compress
         delaycompress
         missingok
         notifempty
      }
